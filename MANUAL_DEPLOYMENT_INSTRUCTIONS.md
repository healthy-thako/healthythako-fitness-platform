# 🚀 Manual Deployment Instructions for Netlify

## ✅ **BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Your project has been built successfully with the payment redirect handler included! Here's how to deploy it manually:

## 📁 **Files Ready for Deployment**

The `dist` directory now contains:
- ✅ **Main website files** (index.html, assets, etc.)
- ✅ **Payment redirect handler** at `dist/payment-redirect/index.html`
- ✅ **Netlify configuration** (_redirects, _headers)

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT METHODS**

### **Method 1: Netlify Dashboard Upload (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Login to your account
   - Find your `healthythako.com` site

2. **Manual Deploy**
   - Click on your site
   - Go to **"Deploys"** tab
   - Scroll down to **"Deploy manually"**
   - Drag the entire `dist` folder to the upload area
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### **Method 2: Netlify CLI (If Available)**

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the dist directory
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### **Method 3: Zip and Upload**

1. **Create Deployment Zip**
   - Right-click on the `dist` folder
   - Select "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
   - Name it `healthythako-deployment.zip`

2. **Upload to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag the zip file to deploy
   - This will create a new site (you can then update your domain)

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

Once deployed, test these URLs:

### **1. Basic Access Test**
```
https://healthythako.com/payment-redirect/
```
**Expected**: Payment redirect handler page loads

### **2. Parameter Test**
```
https://healthythako.com/payment-redirect/?type=success&orderId=test123&source=manual_test
```
**Expected**: Shows success UI with test parameters

### **3. Mobile Test**
```
https://healthythako.com/payment-redirect/?type=success&orderId=mobile_test&source=mobile_app
```
**Expected**: Attempts mobile app redirect

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Payment Redirect Returns 404:**

1. **Check File Structure**
   - Ensure `dist/payment-redirect/index.html` exists
   - Verify file size is ~33KB

2. **Check Netlify Redirects**
   - Look for `dist/_redirects` file
   - Should contain payment redirect rules

3. **Clear Cache**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito/private browsing

### **If CORS Errors Occur:**

1. **Check Headers**
   - Look for `dist/_headers` file
   - Should contain CORS configuration

2. **Verify CSP**
   - Check Content Security Policy allows Supabase
