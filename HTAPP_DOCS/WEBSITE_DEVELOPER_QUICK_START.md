# 🚨 URGENT: Website Developer Quick Start Guide

## Critical Implementation Required

The healthythako.com website developer needs to implement a payment redirect handler to complete the mobile app payment flow.

## 1. Immediate Action Required

### Deploy Payment Redirect Handler

**File Location**: `https://healthythako.com/payment-redirect/index.html`

**What it does**:
- Receives payment redirects from UddoktaPay
- Shows success/cancel UI to users

- Provides fallback options

### URL Format You'll Receive

```
https://healthythako.com/payment-redirect?type=success&orderId=123&source=mobile_app&timestamp=1234567890
```

### What You Need to Return

Deep link the user back to the mobile app:

```javascript
// For successful payments
window.location.href = "healthythako://payment-success?orderId=123&status=completed&source=web_redirect";

// For cancelled payments  
window.location.href = "healthythako://payment-cancel?orderId=123&status=cancelled&source=web_redirect";
```
